One of the key design philosophies of the Linux system is what is expects of the user. Compared to Mac and Windows, where they try to protect the user from getting themselves into trouble, the Linux system assumes that the user knows what they are doing and gives them full access and control to all aspects of their computer.

As for the nine major tenets it has these
1. Small is beautiful
2. Each Program Does One Thing Well
3. Prototype as Soon as Possible
4. Choose Portability Over Efficiency
5. Store Data in Flat Text Files
6. Use Software Leverage
7. Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
8. Avoid Captive User Interfaces
9. Make Every Program a Filer

A VPS, or virtual private server, is a dedicated virtual machine that is hosted on a server that can be used by (paying) customers. It comes with its own copy of an operating system, with the user having high-level access to it, meaning that they can install pretty much anything they want that is compatible with that operating system. Simply put it can be the "virtual" equivalent to owning and using a personal physical server, only instead of buying and paying for a physical machine, you're paying for allocated space on a virtual server. One of the advantages of this is, of course, you don't have to maintain your own server, as that is done by whoever you're paying to have the VPS. It also gives you the ability to customize your Web site and the like. However, the downside is that you have to pay to use it, and you of course lose some control and freedom to manipulate because you're using someone else's server.

The reason you shouldn't run programs in Linux as a root user is similar to why you should install things as an admin in Mac or Windows, in that you're basically installing the program with the highest level access it can have. This means that it gives the program the most control, for better or worse, especially if that program is a virus. Installing programs as a user without root access maintains a security model that prevents things like that from happening.
