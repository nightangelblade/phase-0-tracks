<h1>Maximize Happiness with Different Types of Balloons!</h1>
<p>Want some tips on how to order balloons. It helps to know the differences in the various things that can be done with balloons and how they can be modeled!</p>
<p><strong>Balloon Types</strong><br />
There are numerous types of balloons out there, but to start there's two <em>you need to know about</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Latex: There are your basic types of balloons, which come as long tubes, teardrops, and perfectly round shapes.</li>
<li>Mylars: These are made of a foil-like material that makes them able to take on patterns, prints, and various characters from popular culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know of the two main types of balloons, here are some balloon sculptures you can order toliven up your party, event, or day!</p>
<ol>
<li>Bouquets: Like flower bouquets, these are arranged in such a way that they look a little more organized. Generally they are staggered to be more appealing.</li>
<li>Clusters: These sculptures are tied and twisted together at a central point so that they are facing outwards like a ball or crystal-like shape.</li>
<li>Columns: A series of balloons stacked on each other and held together by a pole or string to give them the appearance of a column. These balloons aren't inflated with helium, as they do not need to float. For outside events, they are usually weighted down with a heavy plate to keep them from being bown away.</li>
<li>Arches: Two columns that are connected by a string of helium-inflated balloons to give the appearance of an archway. Sometimes just the string itself serves as the arch, but for larger installations the colmuns make things a bit easier.</li>
</ol>
