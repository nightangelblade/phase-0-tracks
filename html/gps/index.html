        <p>I believe the purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to provide and easier way for both user and browser to understand the order and organization of a webpage. All of them are useful, but the top one would likely be the main tag, as it dictates what is considered to be the main content of the page.</p>
        <p>Generally a browser is going to load a page by reading the code from top to bottom, so in sequence it will pull the information on the doctype and document first, then follow the the scripts and links in the head tag, followed by the body and so forth.</p>
        <p>In terms of Sublime, and particularly Sublime Text 3, I've found that creating cutom snippets can be an interesting experience. Sublime Text 3 defaults to saving snippets in a hidden folder in the user's Library, which can make creating and editing cutom snippets difficult. However, once done correctly, custom snippets can make work smoother and easier to do with consistent results.</p>
        <p>The most difficult challenge for us this GPS session was actually what happened above with creating custom snippets in Sublime Text 3. It was something that was unexpected and for a time unexplainable, even though the three of us were researching and doing what we could to figure it out. I believe I can improve my understanding of this concept by further researching and understanding the finer nuances of doing so, which will come in handy in the future.</p>
